# OversimplifiedGuide

A collection of guides to avoid repeating common 'favor' tasks.

I tried to keep it as simple as possible (by discarding some details and just give blind instructions) to get things done. Which is what matters for those who don't search, translate and learn, but rather ask for a 'favor'.

Hope this helps.
